## üéØ Overview

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a fundamental financial model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. This project implements CAPM analysis from scratch using Python, providing insights into:

- **Risk Assessment**: How volatile is PG compared to the overall market?
- **Expected Returns**: What return should investors expect based on risk?
- **Risk-Adjusted Performance**: How well does PG perform relative to its risk?

## üìö Theoretical Background

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The CAPM formula calculates the expected return of an asset based on its risk relative to the market:

```
E(Ri) = Rf + Œ≤i √ó (E(Rm) - Rf)
```

Where:
- **E(Ri)** = Expected return of asset i
- **Rf** = Risk-free rate
- **Œ≤i** = Beta of asset i (systematic risk)
- **E(Rm)** = Expected market return

### Beta (Œ≤)
Beta measures an asset's volatility relative to the overall market:
- **Œ≤ = 1**: Asset moves with the market
- **Œ≤ > 1**: Asset is more volatile than the market
- **Œ≤ < 1**: Asset is less volatile than the market

### Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns:
```
Sharpe Ratio = (E(R) - Rf) / œÉ
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CAPM.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run All Cells**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform the complete analysis

3. **Customize Analysis**: Modify the following parameters in the notebook:
   ```python
   # Time period
   start = dt(2012, 1, 1)
   end = dt(2016, 12, 31)
   
   # Stock ticker (change to analyze different stocks)
   tickers = ['PG', '^GSPC']
   
   # Risk-free rate and market risk premium
   rf = 0.025      # 2.5% annual risk-free rate
   rm_rf = 0.05    # 5% market risk premium
   ```

### Analyzing Different Stocks
To analyze a different stock, simply change the ticker symbol:
```python
tickers = ['AAPL', '^GSPC']  # For Apple Inc.
tickers = ['MSFT', '^GSPC']  # For Microsoft Corp.
```

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**
- **Source**: Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` and `pandas_datareader`
- **Assets**: PG (Procter & Gamble) and ^GSPC (S&P 500 as market proxy)
- **Period**: January 2012 ‚Äì December 2016 (5 years of daily data)

### 2. **Return Calculation**
- **Method**: Daily logarithmic returns
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  rt = ln(Pt / Pt-1)
  ```
- **Advantage**: Log returns are time-additive and normally distributed

### 3. **Risk Metrics Computation**
- **Covariance Matrix**: Measures how PG returns move with market returns
- **Variance**: Measures market volatility
- **Annualization**: Multiply by 250 trading days per year

### 4. **Beta Estimation**
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Œ≤ = Cov(RPG, RM) / Var(RM)
  ```
- **Interpretation**: Measures PG's systematic risk relative to the market

### 5. **Expected Return (CAPM)**
- **Application**: Uses CAPM formula with estimated beta
- **Components**: Risk-free rate + Beta √ó Market risk premium

### 6. **Risk-Adjusted Performance**
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures return per unit of risk
- **Comparison**: Enables comparison with other investments

## üìä Results & Interpretation

### Key Findings (2012‚Äì2016 Analysis)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Beta (Œ≤)** | 0.616 | PG is **38% less volatile** than the market. It's a defensive stock. |
| **Expected Return** | 5.58% | Based on CAPM, investors should expect 5.58% annual return from PG. |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.216 | Positive but moderate risk-adjusted performance. |
| **Market Variance** | 0.0164 | S&P 500 annual variance during the period. |
| **Covariance** | 0.0101 | Positive correlation between PG and market returns. |

### Investment Insights
- **Low Risk Profile**: PG's beta of 0.616 indicates it's a defensive stock suitable for risk-averse investors
- **Stable Returns**: Lower volatility suggests more predictable returns
- **Market Correlation**: Positive covariance shows PG generally moves in the same direction as the market, but with less magnitude

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

### CAPM Assumptions
1. **Efficient Markets**: All investors have access to the same information
2. **Single Period**: Analysis assumes a single investment period
3. **Normal Distribution**: Returns are normally distributed
4. **Constant Risk-Free Rate**: Risk-free rate remains constant
5. **No Transaction Costs**: Ignores brokerage fees and taxes

### Project Limitations
- **Historical Data Only**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Single Stock Analysis**: Limited to one stock (PG) in current implementation
- **Fixed Time Period**: Analysis covers only 2012-2016
- **Market Proxy**: Uses S&P 500 as market proxy (may not represent entire market)
- **Static Parameters**: Risk-free rate and market premium are assumed constant
